** Pragati Chaturvedi**

My favorate place is Kasuli,India. Almost 2 years back, I visited this place and it is a cantonment town and a popular hill station in Himachal Pradesh. The town is famous for its lush green and picturesque surroundings of the mountains and its quiet and tourist friendly people.
